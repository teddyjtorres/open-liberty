CWWKD1000.repo.general.err=CWWKD1000E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface encountered an error. The error might indicate that the repository \
 method is not valid. The error is: {2}.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.explanation=An error was found with the specified \
 repository method.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine whether corrections are needed.

CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity=CWWKD1001E: The {0} repository method requires \
 an entity class but the {1} repository interface does not specify a primary \
 entity class. To correct this error, the {1} repository interface can extend \
 one of the built-in repository supertypes, such as {2}, and supply the entity \
 class as the first type parameter.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.explanation=Repository methods without an entity \
 class of their own require the repository to define a primary entity class.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.useraction=Define a primary entity class for the \
 repository.

CWWKD1002.method.annos.err=CWWKD1002E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is annotated with a combination of annotations that is not valid: {2}.

 information for a list of valid return types for the type of repository method.

CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err=CWWKD1005E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is not valid. The method specifies a {2} return type that is \
 not convertible from the {3} entity type. The result type of a \
 find operation must be the entity type, a type of an entity attribute, \
 a Java record composed of entity attributes, or a type constructed \
 by the query that is supplied to the \
 Query annotation. The return type of the repository find method can be \
 the result type, an array of the result type, or any of the following types \
 parameterized with the result type: {4}.

 one of the supported return types for repository find methods.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for a list of valid return types for repository find methods.

CWWKD1006.delete.rtrn.err=CWWKD1006E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a delete \
 operation. The return type must be either void, long, int, boolean, array, \
 List, or Optional. A return type of void returns no value. A return type of \
 long or int returns a deletion count. A return type of boolean returns \
 an indicator of whether any entities were deleted. A return type of array, \
 List, or Optional, that is parameterized with either a {3} entity class or \
 a {4} unique identifier class returns the deleted entities or entity IDs.

 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 {3} operation. The return type must be either void, long, int, or boolean. \
 A return type of void returns no value. A return type of long or int returns \
 a count of matching entities. A return type of boolean returns an indicator \
 of whether any entities match.
CWWKD1007.updel.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for an update or delete operation.
CWWKD1007.updel.rtrn.err.useraction=Update the repository method to use one \
 of the supported return types.

CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err=CWWKD1008E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is ambiguous as a return type because it \
 corresponds to multiple entity attributes: {3}. The repository method \
 must switch to the Query annotation and use a query with a \
 SELECT clause that specifies which entity attribute to return.
CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for a delete method.
CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err.useraction=Update the repository method to use the \
 Query annotation to select the entity attribute.

CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err=CWWKD1009E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot have {2} parameters because the method is annotated with the \
 {3} lifecycle annotation. Repository methods that are annotated with a lifecycle \
 annotation must have exactly 1 parameter, which must be the entity or an \
 array or List of the entity.
CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err.explanation=Lifecycle methods must have a single \
 entity parameter.
CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err.useraction=Update the repository method to have a \
 single parameter that is an entity or an array of List of the entity.

 a valid attribute that is defined by the entity.

CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern=CWWKD1011E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface does not match any of the Jakarta Data defined patterns. \
 A repository method must either use annotations, be a resource accessor method, \
 or be named according to the Query by Method Name pattern. Annotations such as \
 {2} are used to define operations. A resource accessor method must contain \
 no parameters and any of the {3} return types. The Query by Method Name pattern \
 must begin with one of the {4} keywords, followed by 0 or more characters. \
 Method names can also include the By keyword and one or more delimited \
 conditions. Examples of valid repository method names are: {5}.
CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern.explanation=Repository methods must follow the \
 Jakarta Data defined patterns.
CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern.useraction=Update the repository method to \
 adhere to one of the patterns from Jakarta Data.

CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1012E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity attribute. Parameters that \
 do not match an entity attribute must be annotated with the By annotation or have \
 one of the special parameter types: {3}. To define a condition for the \
 restriction of query results, the parameter must be annotated with the By \
 annotation and the value of the By annotation must be assigned to be the entity \
 attribute name. Alternatively, enable the -parameters compile option and give \
 the parameter the same name as the entity attribute.
CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository find and \
 delete methods must correspond to entity attributes or be special Jakarta Data \
 defined parameter types.
CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such \
 that all parameters correspond to entity attributes or have one of the Jakarta \
 Data special parameter types.

CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1013E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity attribute. Parameters \
 that do not match an entity attribute must be annotated with the By annotation and \
 the By annotation value must be assigned to be the entity attribute name. \
 Alternatively, enable the -parameters compile option and give the parameter \
 the same name as the entity attribute.
CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository count, \
 delete, and exists methods must correspond to entity attributes.
CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such \
 that all parameters correspond to entity attributes.

CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1014E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity attribute. Parameters that \
 do not match an entity attribute must have one of the parameter annotations: {3}. \
 To define a condition for the restriction of query results, the parameter must \
 be annotated with the By annotation and the By annotation value must be \
 assigned to be the entity attribute name. Alternatively, enable the \
 -parameters compile option and give the parameter the same name as the entity \
 attribute.
CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository update \
 methods must correspond to entity attributes.
CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such that \
 all parameters correspond to entity attributes.

CWWKD1015.null.entity.param=CWWKD1015E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot accept a null entity.
CWWKD1015.null.entity.param.explanation=Lifecycle methods require a non-null \
 entity instance.
CWWKD1015.null.entity.param.useraction=Update application code to avoid supplying \
 a null entity value to the repository method.

CWWKD1016.incompat.entity.param=CWWKD1016E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface requires a {2} entity, but a {3} value was supplied.
CWWKD1016.incompat.entity.param.explanation=The lifecycle method accepts only \
 entity values of the declared type.
CWWKD1016.incompat.entity.param.useraction=Update application code to supply an \
 entity value of the same entity type that the repository method declares.

 cannot have a {2} parameter and a {3} parameter.
CWWKD1018.confl.special.param.explanation=Some of the Jakarta Data special \
 parameters, such as Limit and PageRequest, cannot be combined on a single \
 repository method signature.
CWWKD1018.confl.special.param.useraction=Update the repository to not use \
 both of the Jakarta Data special parameter types in the same method signature.

CWWKD1019.mixed.positional.named=CWWKD1019E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot have a query that mixes positional and named parameters. \
 The interface defines a mix of {2} positional parameters and
 {3} named parameters {4} for the Query annotation value: {5}. A query with \
 positional parameters must reference each parameter by its ordinal value, \
 starting with ?1, and the method parameters must not have the Param annotation. \
 In a query with named parameters, each parameter must be referenced by its name, \
 such as {6}, and the method parameters must have the Param annotation, \
 such as {7}. Alternatively, enabling the -parameters compile option allows \
 method parameters to indicate the named parameter by matching its name, \
 for example, {8}.
CWWKD1019.mixed.positional.named.explanation=Queries with parameters must use all \
 named parameters or all positional parameters, not a combination.
CWWKD1019.mixed.positional.named.useraction=Update the repository method to use \
 only named parameters or only positional parameters.

CWWKD1020.invalid.param.type=CWWKD1020E: Parameters of the {0} method of the \
 {1} repository interface must not be of the {2} type because the repository \
 method is a {3} operation.

 comparisons of values require a corresponding number of repository method \
 parameters to supply the values.
CWWKD1021.insufficient.params.useraction=Update the repository method to define \
 a method parameter for each value that is required by a comparison.

CWWKD1022.too.many.params=CWWKD1022E: The query conditions of the {0} method \
 of the {1} repository interface require {2} parameters, but the repository \
 method signature has {3} parameters. The query for the method is: {4}.
CWWKD1022.too.many.params.explanation=Query conditions that define \
 comparisons of values require a corresponding number of repository method \
 parameters to supply the values. Extra parameters are not permitted.

 for a repository method must include an entity attribute name.
CWWKD1024.missing.entity.attr.useraction=Inspect the declaration and usage of \
 the repository method to ensure that an entity attribute name is supplied for \
 each query condition and sort criterion.

CWWKD1025.missing.id.attr=CWWKD1025E: The {0} entity class that is used by the \
 {1} method of the {2} repository interface does not have an ID attribute.
CWWKD1025.missing.id.attr.explanation=Repository methods that delete and return \
 an entity must have an ID attribute.
CWWKD1025.missing.id.attr.useraction=If the entity does not have a single \
 attribute for the ID, define separate repository methods that query for the \
 entity and delete the entity.

CWWKD1026.ignore.case.not.text=CWWKD1026E: The {0} attribute of the {1} entity is \
 not a character or character sequence; therefore, the {2} sort criteria must not \
 specify to ignore case. The type of the attribute is {3}, and it was supplied to \
 the {4} method of the {5} repository interface.
CWWKD1026.ignore.case.not.text.explanation=Sorting with case ignored is only \
 possible with entity attributes that represent text.
CWWKD1026.ignore.case.not.text.useraction=Ensure the sort criteria is applied \
 to the correct entity attribute and remove the instruction to ignore case if the \
 entity attribute does not represent text.

CWWKD1027.anno.missing.attr.name=CWWKD1027E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface is annotated with an {3} annotation that does not \
 specify an entity attribute name as its value. The annotation must either specify \
 the entity attribute name as its value, or the -parameters compile option must be \
 enabled and the parameter must have the same name as the entity attribute.
CWWKD1027.anno.missing.attr.name.explanation=Parameters of repository update \
 methods must correspond to entity attributes.
CWWKD1027.anno.missing.attr.name.useraction=Update the repository method to \
 indicate the entity attribute to which the parameter pertains.

CWWKD1028.first.exceeds.max=CWWKD1028E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface requests the first {2} results, which exceeds the maximum allowed \
 number of results: {3}.

 the entity name.
CWWKD1030.ql.lacks.entity.useraction=Update the query for repository method to \
 include the entity name.

CWWKD1031.ql.similar.entity=CWWKD1031E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface specifies a query that requires a {2} entity name that is not found \
 but is a close match for the {3} entity name. The query is: {4}.
CWWKD1031.ql.similar.entity.explanation=The query might have a typographical \
 error in its reference to the entity name.
CWWKD1031.ql.similar.entity.useraction=Review the query to ensure the correct \
 entity name is used.

CWWKD1032.ql.unknown.entity=CWWKD1032E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface specifies a query that requires a {2} entity name that is not found. \
 Ensure that {2} is the name of a valid entity. To enable the entity to be found, \
 give the repository a lifecycle method that is annotated with one of the {3} \
 annotations and supply the entity as its parameter. Alternatively, have the \
 repository extend the DataRepository interface or another built-in repository \
 interface, with the entity class as the first type variable. The query is: {4}.
CWWKD1032.ql.unknown.entity.explanation=The query might have a typographical error \
 in its reference to the entity name, or the repository does not specify its \
 primary entity class.
CWWKD1032.ql.unknown.entity.useraction=Review the query to ensure the correct \
 entity name is used. Review the repository definition to ensure the correct \
 primary entity class is specified.

CWWKD1033.ql.orderby.disallowed=CWWKD1033E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot specify a query that includes an ORDER BY clause because \
 the method returns {2}. Remove the ORDER BY clause and instead use the {3} \
 annotation to specify static sort criteria. The query is: {4}.
CWWKD1033.ql.orderby.disallowed.explanation=The ORDER BY clause is incompatible \
 with cursor-based pagination.

 the method returns {2}. There WHERE clause ends at position {3}, but the \
 length of the query is {4}. The query is: {5}.
CWWKD1034.ql.where.required.explanation=A WHERE clause is required when \
 using cursor-based pagination.
CWWKD1034.ql.where.required.useraction=Add a WHERE clause to the query.

CWWKD1035.incompat.page.mode=CWWKD1035E: A page request with the {0} pagination \
 mode must not be supplied to the {1} method of the {2} repository interface \
 because the method returns {3} instead of {4}.
CWWKD1035.incompat.page.mode.explanation=The requested pagination mode is \
 not compatible with the return type of the repository method.
CWWKD1035.incompat.page.mode.useraction=Use a return type of Page for the \
 OFFSET pagination mode and a return type of CursoredPage for the CURSOR_NEXT \
 and CURSOR_PREVIOUS pagination modes.

CWWKD1036.cursor.size.mismatch=CWWKD1036E: A cursor with {0} elements that is \
 supplied to the {1} method of the {2} repository interface cannot be used with \
 sort criteria of size {3} because the number and order of the cursor elements \
 must match the sort criteria. The cursor consists of: {4}. The sort criteria is: \
 {5}.
CWWKD1036.cursor.size.mismatch.explanation=The number of cursor elements must \
 match the size of the combined sort criteria of the repository method.
CWWKD1036.cursor.size.mismatch.useraction=Correct the cursor elements or the \
 sort criteria such that both have the same size.

CWWKD1037.cursor.rtrn.mismatch=CWWKD1037E: Unable to obtain a cursor from the \
 {0} result of the {1} method of the {2} repository interface. Queries that \
 use cursor-based pagination must return results of the same type as the \
 entity type, which is {3}. The repository method return type is {4}.
CWWKD1037.cursor.rtrn.mismatch.explanation=Cursor-based pagination is only \
 possible when the repository method returns the entity type.
CWWKD1037.cursor.rtrn.mismatch.useraction=Update the repository method to \
 return the entity type.

CWWKD1038.no.prev.offset.page=CWWKD1038E: A page number prior to {0} cannot \
 be requested for the {1} method of the {2} repository interface because the \
 Page.hasPrevious method returns false, indicating there is no previous page.
CWWKD1038.no.prev.offset.page.explanation=Offset pagination does not allow \
 page numbers less than 1.
CWWKD1038.no.prev.offset.page.useraction=Ensure that the requested page number \
 is a positive number and use the Page.hasPrevious method to ensure it is valid \
 to request the previous page.

CWWKD1039.no.prev.cursor.page=CWWKD1039E: A previous page cannot be requested \
 for the {0} method of the {1} repository interface because the Page.hasPrevious \
 method returns false, indicating there is no previous page.

 interface has a {2} return type but lacks a parameter of type PageRequest \
 following the parameters for the query conditions.
CWWKD1041.rtrn.mismatch.pagereq.explanation=Repository methods with the Page \
 and CursoredPage return types must have a PageRequest parameter.
CWWKD1041.rtrn.mismatch.pagereq.useraction=Add a PageRequest parameter to the \
 repository method signature.

CWWKD1042.no.totals=CWWKD1042E: Pages that are retrieved by the {0} method of \
 the {1} repository interface do not include a total count of elements and pages \
 because the {2} page request specifies a value of false for requestTotal. \
 To request a page with the total count included, use the PageRequest.withTotal \
 method instead of the PageRequest.withoutTotal method.
CWWKD1042.no.totals.explanation=The PageRequest.withoutTotal method specifies that \
 requested pages do not include a total count of elements and pages.
CWWKD1042.no.totals.useraction=Use the PageRequest.withTotal method to request a \
 total count of elements and pages.

CWWKD1043.offset.exceeds.max=CWWKD1043E: The {0} offset that is needed for the \
 {1} page request that is supplied to the {2} method of the {3} repository \
 interface exceeds the maximum allowed value of {4}.

 accessor method is not one of the supported types for Jakarta Data.
CWWKD1044.invalid.resource.type.useraction=Remove the method or update it to \
 return one of the supported types.

CWWKD1045.unknown.entity.anno=CWWKD1045E: The built-in Jakarta Data provider \
 cannot provide an implementation of the {0} repository interface because the \
 {1} entity class that is used by the repository includes an unrecognized entity \
 annotation. The following entity annotations are found on the entity class: {2}. \
 Supported entity annotations are: {3}.

 Alternatively, assign the dataStore value of the Repository annotation \
 to be the identifier of a databaseStore element or the JNDI name of \
 a data source resource reference or persistence unit reference \
 that is accessible to the application artifact. A databaseStore element \
 can be defined in server configuration. For example, {4} \
 An application component can use the Resource annotation to define a \
 data source resource reference. For example, {5}, which requires server \
 configuration to have a dataSource configuration element with a {6} attribute. \
 An application component can use the PersistenceUnit annotation to define a \
 persistence unit reference. For example, {7}, which requires the persistence.xml \
 file to have a persistence-unit element with a matching name attribute. \
 For example, {8}
CWWKD1077.defaultds.not.found.explanation=Jakarta Data repositories default to \
 the Jakarta EE default data source, which must be configured in server \
 configuration.

 persistence unit reference. For example, {7}, which requires the persistence.xml \
 file to have a persistence-unit element with a matching name attribute. \
 For example, {8}
CWWKD1078.datastore.not.found.explanation=The data store of a Jakarta Data \
 repository can be the ID of a dataSource element or databaseStore element \
 in server configuration, or it can be a JNDI name of a data source, data source \
 resource reference, or persistence unit reference.
CWWKD1078.datastore.not.found.useraction=Ensure that the resource is configured \
 correctly. If using a JNDI name, ensure that the scope of the JNDI name makes \
 the resource accessible to the application artifact that provides the repository.

CWWKD1079.jndi.not.found=CWWKD1079E: One or more repository interfaces ({0}) from \
 the {1} application artifact specify a data store with the {2} JNDI name, \
 but a data source, data source resource reference, or persistence unit reference \
 with that JNDI name is not accessible to the application artifact, \
 or one of the related resources is not configured correctly. \
 An application component can use the Resource annotation to define a \
 data source resource reference. For example, {3}, which points to a \
 dataSource server configuration element with a {4} attribute. \
 An application component can use the PersistenceUnit annotation to define a \
 persistence unit reference. For example, {5}, which requires the persistence.xml \
 file to have a persistence-unit element with a matching name attribute. \
 For example, {6} \
 An application component can use the DataSourceDefinition annotation \
 to define a data source. Alternatively, a dataSource element can define a \
 data source in the server configuration. For example, {7}
CWWKD1079.jndi.not.found.explanation=When the data store of a Jakarta Data \
 repository is set to a JNDI name of a data source, a data source resource \
 reference, or a persistence unit reference, the JNDI name must be accessible \
 to the application artifact that provides the repository, and the data source \
 or persistence unit must be configured correctly.
CWWKD1079.jndi.not.found.useraction=Ensure that the resource is configured \
 correctly, and ensure that the scope of the JNDI name makes the resource \
 accessible to the application artifact that provides the repository.

CWWKD1080.datastore.general.err=CWWKD1080E: One or more repository interfaces \

 to exactly one query parameter.
CWWKD1083.dup.method.param.useraction=Check if each of the method parameters \
 specifies the correct named parameter. Remove duplicate method parameters. \

CWWKD1084.missing.named.params=CWWKD1084E: The parameters of the {0} method \
 of the {1} repository interface do not define the named parameters ({2}) \
 that are required by the Query annotation value: {3}. You can define a \
 named parameter for the query by placing the Param annotation on a \
 corresponding method parameter. For example, {4}. Alternatively, if you \
 enable the -parameters compile option, you can omit the Param annotation \
 if you name the method parameter to have the same name as the named parameter. \
 For example, if String is the named parameter type, the method parameter \
 can be {5}, which does not require the Param annotation.
CWWKD1084.missing.named.params.explanation=The Query annotation value requires \
 one or more named parameters that are not supplied by the repository method.
CWWKD1084.missing.named.params.useraction=Add parameters to the repository method \
 to specify the missing named parameters.

CWWKD1085.extra.method.params=CWWKD1085E: The parameters of the {0} method \
 of the {1} repository interface define query parameters ({2}), which do not \
 match any of the named parameters ({3}) that are used by the Query annotation \
 value: {4}.
CWWKD1085.extra.method.params.explanation=All the method parameters must be \
 used by the query or be Jakarta Data defined parameter types.
CWWKD1085.extra.method.params.useraction=Remove the extra method parameters.

CWWKD1086.named.params.unused=CWWKD1086E: The parameters of the {0} method \
 of the {1} repository interface define named parameters ({2}), which are not \
 used in the Query annotation value: {3}. You can refer to named parameters \
 in a query by using the : character followed by the parameter name. \
 For example, {4}. Positional parameters in a query can be referenced by using \
 the ? character followed by an ordinal value, starting with ?1. Avoid \
 annotating method parameters with the Param annotation when the query \
 uses positional parameters or has no parameters.
CWWKD1086.named.params.unused.explanation=The Param annotation can only be used \
 when the query has named parameters.
CWWKD1086.named.params.unused.useraction=Remove the Param annotation or switch \
 the query to use named parameters.

CWWKD1089.unordered.pagination=CWWKD1089E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface must specify the sort criteria because the method returns a {2} value. \
 Unordered data cannot be split into pages.
CWWKD1089.unordered.pagination.explanation=Pagination requires ordered data.
CWWKD1089.unordered.pagination.useraction=Use the OrderBy annotation to define \
 the sort criteria for the repository method.

CWWKD1090.orderby.conflict=CWWKD1090E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot combine the OrderBy annotation and the OrderBy keyword.
CWWKD1090.orderby.conflict.explanation=The OrderBy annotation is not compatible \
 with the OrderBy keyword.

 Valid attribute names for the entity are: {5}.
CWWKD1091.method.name.parse.err.explanation=The repository method name was parsed \
 according to the Query by Method Name pattern because the repository method \
 does not have a Jakarta Data annotation that indicates the type of operation.
CWWKD1091.method.name.parse.err.useraction=Correct the repository method name \
 or annotate the repository method to indicate a Jakarta Data operation such as \
 Query, Find, or Save.

CWWKD1092.lifecycle.arg.empty=CWWKD1092E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 does not accept an empty {2} parameter. The parameter value must contain at \
 least one entity.
CWWKD1092.lifecycle.arg.empty.explanation=Insert, Update, Save, and Delete methods
 require at least one entity.
CWWKD1092.lifecycle.arg.empty.useraction=Ensure that the array, List, or Stream \
 that is supplied to the method contains at least one entity.

CWWKD1093.fn.not.applicable=CWWKD1093E: The {0} function cannot be evaluated \
 for the {1} entity that is used by the {2} method of the {3} repository \
 interface. The entity does not have an attribute that is annotated with {4} \
 or from which {0} can be inferred.
CWWKD1093.fn.not.applicable.explanation=The function cannot be used on the entity \
 because the entity lacks an ID or version attribute.
CWWKD1093.fn.not.applicable.useraction=Do not use the function in query language \
 or parameters for the repository method.

CWWKD1094.return.mismatch=CWWKD1094E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface has the {2} return type, which is not capable of returning the number \
 of entities, {3}, that the repository method accepts as a parameter. \
 Valid return types for a {4} method that accepts multiple entities include: {5}.
CWWKD1094.return.mismatch.explanation=A repository life cycle method that \
 returns entities must be able to return the same number of entities as are \
 accepted by the method.
CWWKD1094.return.mismatch.useraction=Update the repository method to either use \
 a return type that can return multiple entities or update the repository method \
 to accept only a single entity.

CWWKD1095.repo.err=CWWKD1095E: An implementation of the {0} repository interface \
 cannot be provided due to an error. The repository annotation is {1}. \
 The primary entity class is {2}. The error is: {3}
CWWKD1095.repo.err.explanation=The built-in Jakarta Data provider is unable \
 to provide an instance of the repository due to an error.
CWWKD1095.repo.err.useraction=Investigate the error and correct \
 the repository interface, entities, data store configuration, or database.

CWWKD1096.orderby.incompat=CWWKD1096E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has an OrderBy annotation, but the {0} method is not a find operation or a \
 delete operation that returns entities.
CWWKD1096.orderby.incompat.explanation=The OrderBy annotation is not compatible \
 with the type of repository operation.
CWWKD1096.orderby.incompat.useraction=Remove the OrderBy annotation.

CWWKD1097.param.incompat=CWWKD1097E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has a {2} parameter, but the {0} method is not a find operation or a \
 delete operation that returns entities.
CWWKD1097.param.incompat.explanation=Order, Sort, and Limit parameters are \
 not compatible with the type of repository operation.
CWWKD1097.param.incompat.useraction=Remove the Order, Sort, or Limit parameter.

CWWKD1098.spec.param.position.err=CWWKD1098E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has a {2} parameter that is positioned before the query parameters. \
 Parameter types that have special meaning in Jakarta Data ({3}) must be \
 positioned after the other parameters in the repository method signature.
CWWKD1098.spec.param.position.err.explanation=When special Jakarta Data defined \
 parameter types are included in a repository method signture, they must be \
 positioned after all the query parameters.
CWWKD1098.spec.param.position.err.useraction=Move the special Jakarta Data defined \
 parameter types to positions at the end of the repository method signature.

CWWKD1099.first.keyword.incompat=CWWKD1099E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has a name that includes the First keyword, which is incompatible with the \
 {2} parameter of the method.
CWWKD1099.first.keyword.incompat.explanation=A Query by Method Name method \
 that includes a Limit or PageRequest parameter cannot use the First keyword.
CWWKD1099.first.keyword.incompat.useraction=Remove the First keyword from the \
 method name.

CWWKD1100.cursor.requires.sort=CWWKD1100E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 returns {2} but does not have an OrderBy annotation or any of the following \
 parameters to specify sort criteria: {3}. Sort criteria is required for \
 cursor-based pagination and cannot be specified within an ORDER BY clause of \
 a Query annotation value.
CWWKD1100.cursor.requires.sort.explanation=Cursor-based pagination requires \
 sort criteria.
CWWKD1100.cursor.requires.sort.useraction=Remove the ORDER BY clause from the \
 Query annotation value if one is found there. Add an OrderBy annotation or a \
 repository method parameter to specify the sort criteria.

CWWKD1101.attr.subset.mismatch=CWWKD1101E: The {0} return type of the \
 {1} method of the {2} repository uses the {3} Java record type to define the \
 results to be a subset of entity attributes: {4}. However, at least one of the \
 requested attribute names is not present on the {5} entity. To return a subset \
 of entity attributes as a Java record, ensure that the record component names \
 are within the following set of valid attribute names for the {5} entity: {6}. \
 Alternatively, use the Select annotation to assign valid entity attribute names. \
 To return a single entity attribute that has a Java record type, annotate \
 the {1} method to have a Select annotation and assign its member value \
 to the name of the entity attribute.
CWWKD1101.attr.subset.mismatch.explanation=When Java records are used to \
 retrieve a subset of entity attributes, all of the record components must \
 correspond to valid entity attributes.
CWWKD1101.attr.subset.mismatch.useraction=Rename the record components to \
 match valid entity attribute names, or use the Select annotation to explicitly \
 request entity attributes by their name.

CWWKD1102.incompat.query.result=CWWKD1102E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has the {2} return type, but the Jakarta Persistence provider performed a \
 query with results of the {3} type. Check whether the Jakarta Persistence \
 provider allows querying for the types of entity attributes that the {0} method \
 selects. Check for other causes of incompatibility if the Jakarta provider does \
 allow querying for the types of entity attributes that the {0} method selects.
CWWKD1102.incompat.query.result.explanation=Jakarta Persistence providers do not \
 allow returning all types of entity attributes. If the Jakarta provider does \
 return the type of entity attributes that the method selected, another cause \
 of incompatibility exists. For example, the Jakarta Persistence provider might \
 have a bug or the repository method signature might have an error.
CWWKD1102.incompat.query.result.useraction=If the type of entity attributes that \
 the method selects is not allowed, modify the query to retrieve the whole entity \
 or a different set of entity attributes that the Jakarta Persistence provider \
 allows. If the type of entity attributes that the method selects is allowed, \
 check for other causes of incompatibility.

CWWKD1103.incompat.query.result=CWWKD1103E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 has the {2} return type, but the Jakarta Persistence provider performed a \
 {3} query with results of the {4} type. Check whether the Jakarta Persistence \
 provider allows querying for the types of entity attributes that the {0} method \
 selects. Check for other causes of incompatibility if the Jakarta provider does \
 allow querying for the types of entity attributes that the {0} method selects.
CWWKD1103.incompat.query.result.explanation=Jakarta Persistence providers do not \
 allow returning all types of entity attributes. If the Jakarta provider does \
 return the type of entity attributes that the method selected, another cause \
 of incompatibility exists. For example, the Jakarta Persistence provider might \
 have a bug or the repository method signature might have an error.
CWWKD1103.incompat.query.result.useraction=If the type of entity attributes that \
 the method selects is not allowed, modify the query to retrieve the whole entity \
 or a different set of entity attributes that the Jakarta Persistence provider \
 allows. If the type of entity attributes that the method selects is allowed, \
 check for other causes of incompatibility.
