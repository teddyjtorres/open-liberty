PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_STOPPED=CWWKS1851I: The custom password encryption service has stopped. The class name is {0}.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_STOPPED.explanation=This message is for informational purposes only.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_STOPPED.useraction=No action is required.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_DECRYPTION_ERROR=CWWKS1852E: There was an unexpected exception during password decryption by using the custom password encryption service.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_DECRYPTION_ERROR.explanation=There was an unexpected exception while processing the decryption by using the custom password encryption service.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_DECRYPTION_ERROR.useraction=Check the custom password encryption service logs and server logs for more information about the cause of the exception.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_ENCRYPTION_ERROR=CWWKS1853E: There was an unexpected exception during password encryption by using the custom password encryption service.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_ENCRYPTION_ERROR.explanation=There was an unexpected exception while processing the encryption by using the custom password encryption service.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_ENCRYPTION_ERROR.useraction=Check the custom password encryption service logs and server logs for more information about the cause of the exception.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST=CWWKS1854E: The third party custom password service is not available to process the custom encoded password.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST.explanation=The custom encoded password cannot be processed because the custom password service is not available.
PASSWORDUTIL_CUSTOM_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST.useraction=Make sure that the custom password user feature that implements the com.ibm.wsspi.security.crypto.CustomPasswordEncryption interface is configured and started.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM=CWWKS1855E: The password was not processed because the password algorithm name {0} is not supported. The supported types are {1}.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM.explanation=The password was not encrypted or decrypted because the supplied password algorithm name is not supported.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM.useraction=Make sure that one of the supported algorithms is used.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1856E: The password was not processed because an unknown password algorithm exception was reported.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.explanation=The specified algorithm is not supported.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.useraction=Check the server log and if the custom password encryption is used check the custom password encryption logs for further information.
PASSWORDUTIL_CYPHER_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1857E: The password was not processed because an invalid password cipher exception was reported.
PASSWORDUTIL_CYPHER_EXCEPTION.explanation=The password was not encrypted or decrypted because the exception was reported while processing the password.
PASSWORDUTIL_CYPHER_EXCEPTION.useraction=Check the server log and if the custom password encryption is used check the custom password encryption logs for further information.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNSUPPORTEDENCODING_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1858E: The password was not processed because an unsupported encoding exception was reported.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNSUPPORTEDENCODING_EXCEPTION.explanation=The password was not encrypted or decrypted because the exception was reported while processing the password.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNSUPPORTEDENCODING_EXCEPTION.useraction=Check the server log and if the custom password encryption is used check the custom password encryption logs for further information.
PASSWORDUTIL_INVALID_BASE64_STRING=CWWKS1859E: The password was not decrypted because a decoding error was reported.
PASSWORDUTIL_INVALID_BASE64_STRING.explanation=The encrypted password was not encoded properly.
PASSWORDUTIL_INVALID_BASE64_STRING.useraction=Make sure that the encrypted password is not truncated and encoded with Base64 encoding.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_AES128_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM=CWWKS1860E: AES-128 encrypted passwords cannot be used when FIPS 140-3 is enabled. Regenerate the password with AES-256 using the securityUtility command.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_AES128_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM.explanation=FIPS 140-3 is enabled and does not support AES-128. Use the securityUtility command to encrypt the password using AES-256.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_AES128_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM.useraction=Make sure the password is encrypted with AES-256.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1861E: AES password encryption failed. Check your java.security settings and add the missing algorithm.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.explanation=An encryption algorithm is missing from your java.security file.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.useraction=Make sure that the algorithm is added to your java.security file.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_DECRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION=CWWKS1862E: AES password decryption failed. Check your java.security settings and add the missing algorithm.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_DECRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.explanation=An encryption algorithm is missing from your java.security file.
PASSWORDUTIL_UNAVAILABLE_DECRYPTION_ALGORITHM_EXCEPTION.useraction=Make sure that the algorithm is added to your java.security file.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_HASH_SHA1_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM=CWWKS1863E: You cannot use SHA1 hash-encoded passwords when FIPS 140-3 is enabled. Regenerate the password hash using the securityUtility command.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_HASH_SHA1_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM.explanation=FIPS 140-3 is enabled and does not support SHA1. Use the securityUtility encode command to generate a new SHA512 password hash.
PASSWORDUTIL_EXCEPTION_FIPS140_3_HASH_SHA1_UNAVAILABLE_ALGORITHM.useraction=Make sure the password hash is generated with SHA512.
PASSWORDUTIL_WEAK_ALGORITHM_WARNING=CWWKS1864W: One or more {0} password values stored in the server configuration were generated with an older algorithm{1}. Use the securityUtility encode command to re-generate the {0} passwords with the latest algorithm{2}.
